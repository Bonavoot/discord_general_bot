# discord_general_bot

This discord general bot was originally made to be a 'ready checker' for my discord friends
to and I to use to "group up". As of now its only feature is a 'ready check' but I plan on adding additional commands in the future.

This was a huge learning experience for me and a tremendous amount of fun to make so far. Taking in user feedback and changing code accordingly, reading unfamiliar documentation and getting the hang of it quicker than I thought (Relied on myself and avoided youtube unless absolutely necessary in hopes to make myself better at reading documentation) and using github + file management in general helped me learn so much in such a small amount of time.

Technologies used:

- JavaScript
- Asynchronous code (async/await/promises)
- Discord js documentation
- Node.js
- Github
